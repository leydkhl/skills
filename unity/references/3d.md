The Large 3D channels setting for Vivox is a feature that allows a Vivox backend to support up to 2000 participants in a 3D channel.

Large 3D channels are an enterprise-only feature. To enable this feature, contact your support engineer.

Because Large 3D channels can include up to 2000 participants, ensure that you consider the following during the implementation process:

The application can preemptively block any audio from a blocked player reaching the blocking player when a block list is sent by vx_req_account_control_communications during login. If you wait until you get a ParticipantAdded event to start blocking a player, some initial audio may get through.

It can be tempting to create an “auditorium mode” by putting all 2000 participants (or a large group of participants) at the origin location. However, this will lead to poor performance and is therefore discouraged. Do not place a large number of participants close together (for example, at the same audible distance). Otherwise, audio artifacts can potentially occur.

Due to the changed XMPP behavior necessary to achieve performant Large 3D channels, text messaging will only work in 2D (non-positional) channels when Large 3D is enabled.

Due to the changed XMPP behavior in Large 3D channels, display names currently do not work in Large 3D channels. Display names will continue to work in 2D (non-positional) channels.

Large 3D is a limited feature enabled or disabled for a customer. When enabled, customers cannot build their application to use the original (Small 3D) behavior.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
vx_req_account_control_communications
